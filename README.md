Project Overview Client Details 

*Instatute*  is  a  private  tutoring  company  operating  across  multiple  locations  in  Australia. Currently, *Instatute* provides one-on-one and group tutoring to prepare students for special entry university exams for both Australian and international institutions. In addition to some administrative support workers and managers, employees of *Instatute* are mostly part-time educators specialising in a broad range of fields.* 

Project Description 

*Instatute* is very interested in the idea of gamification as a tool for increasing engagement and community in their teaching. To this end, they would like to investigate software tools that could support them. Due to internal company policy and legal constraints, any tool they use would need to be built specifically for them. Although this policy means that *Instatute* cannot use existing tools, it does not mean that they can’t take inspiration from such tools’ features and designs. 

Being new to the idea, *Instatute* does not yet have a solid concept for how they want to incorporate gamification into their work, or what tools would help them do so. Some ideas that have been floated include: 

- An online quiz platform 
- Interactive exercises or games for specific subjects (e.g., maths) 
- Web forums for discussing work and sharing resources 

For this project, *Instatute* requests that you select one idea to research, design, and prototype for their review. This can be one of the ideas suggested by *Instatute* staff and listed above, or a new idea proposed by your development group. 

*Instatute* has indicated it would prefer a Python-based solution, due to the wide community and with the option of integrating analytics solutions in the future. However, if your team has a different approach to implementation that you think would be appropriate, you are welcome to pursue this.
